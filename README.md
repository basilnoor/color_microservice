<h3> How to REQUEST data from microservice </h3>

In order to request data from the microservice you will need to make a POST request to the 
  local host that the microservice is running on and make sure to include the users input for the
  rgb decimal code.
  
  - the POST request must be made to http://localhost:4000/
  - must also include the rgb decimal code
  
  example call using axios in react:
```
  const RequestData = async (event) => {
    await axios.post('http://localhost:4000/', {
      rgb,
    });
  };
```
